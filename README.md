# vakinha_burguer_mobile

A new Flutter project by the Academia do Flutter's Dart Week.

With this project I had the opportunity to get to know a lot of Flutter widgets and implementations, and also a project structure, with access to the BackEnd.

There is still a lot for me to explore in this project.

Vakinha Burguer is a delivery application for snacks, with payment with Pix.
